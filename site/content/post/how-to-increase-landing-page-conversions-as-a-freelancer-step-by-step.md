Marketers and copywriters are always trying to solve this problem, looking for new ways to make their mark on new customers. Often times this process is rushed, causing the potential customer to be driven away by poorly written copy and design...

I'll walk you through the process of creating engaging landing pages that will not only peak new customer interest, but if done well - convert to new sales.

## 1. Be Human

Have you ever been scrolling through social media and some how manage to click on an ad stating 

> How I turned $5 into $300k in a WEEKEND!

Maybe it's the absurdity of the claim, maybe curiosity... but you clicked it.

Now you're on a page with 4 different pop ups, some guy in a suit yelling at you, and a giant red button with _**MAKE MONEY NOW!!**_ flashing in your face... you get the idea.

The internet has evolved. Psychologically, so has its users. 

We recognize spam a mile away. 

We avoid advertisements at all cost, and not necessarily because we wouldn't necessarily interested in the content, but because of the way it's presented.

It doesn't matter how pretty you make your page, the content is the most important part and must resonate with your targeted customer.

Know who it is that you're talking to (know your audience). Take a moment to stand in their shoes. 

If you wouldn't click or buy, why would they? Make your message human, like you were speaking to a family member or friend.

## 2. Your Page _is not_ an Island

No one is going to be landing on your page without a pathway. 

Whatever they clicked (social media post, facebook ad, etc.) , any conversation that takes place (reddit post, newsletter, etc.) needs to be in synergy with the page. 

What do I mean by that?

If your ads or posts aren't portraying the same message as your landing page's message, your targeted customers will be confused.

How would you like to click on an ad you think is promoting a unique dog leash... only to be taken to a page talking about a pet cemetery? 

Not ideal. 

Make sure your messages are working synchronously on all platforms. 

Use the same or similar copy and images as your landing page when creating ads. 

The last thing you want is your customer to go from interested to confused.

## 3. Have Order _not_ Chaos - Quality over Quantity

It's one thing to communicate the **right message**, it's an entirely other beast to do so in the **right order**. 

Would **you** buy a product without researching it in some way? 

Almost all consumers will first need to know _something_ about a product they're buying.

They're reading reviews, asking a friend or family member, or looking for a video review of said product.

**Predict the question that you think your customers would have about your product or service.**

![Above the Fold Content 10% Matching & 90% Convincing](/img/above-the-fold.png "Above the Fold Content 10% Matching & 90% Convincing")

Don't just take all of your copy you have spent time writing and throw it on the page. Carefully create the sequence of answers to the questions you are predicting your customers will have. 

Create your copy structure _like a conversation_.

## 4. Sell the Experience

What sounds better?

> â€¢ _Grow Microgreens Indoors_

or

> _Start your very own microgreen farm right in your own living room with our step by step process._

Again, maybe click baity, but back to the **be human** section - we are trying to have a conversation, not sound like a robot. 

At the same time, you should be _proving_ how your product or service works. 

**Why would I buy something from you if you don't have proof of work?**

Trust is a hard thing to come by on the internet. 

Do you have people who have used your product or service? _**Ask them for a review!**_

Testimonials/reviews are a great form of trust. You have proven user experience and feedback for you or your client.

... At the same time, we know in 2019 that reviews can be bought and paid for, so what matters in that case?

Consider using

* Established individuals/companies for your reviews & testimonials
* Factual statistics
* Details

While it's important to explain your product or service, you don't always need to be describing features when most people are looking for how your product or service is going to _benefit_ them.

## 5.  Don't over complicate it. Keep it simple.

Easier said than done right? 

The last thing you want is a potential customer to actually get to your landing page... then turn away, strictly because they were overwhelmed with the presentation of the content.

So in a recap, here's my summary of what I think a _**good**_ landing page should have/do - and some additional tips to consider.

1. **Call to Action** - Only have **one** of these on your landing page. A _**call to action**_ being 'Sign up for our email list' or 'Click to download our FREE guide'... if there's too many to choose from, I probably won't pick **ANY** as the potential customer! ***\*This especially becomes the case when I'm greeted with pop-ups as well... Also, if you're using a form - keep it simple. **Name & email.\*\* 
2. **Unique Selling Proposition -**  A _**unique selling proposition**_  is the unique benefit you are bringing to the table that your competition isn't. How are you differentiating from your competition? Find out what sets you apart from the rest, and use that as a key benefit in your copy writing. 
3. **Fast Loading -** This one is wayyyy overlooked! If your page takes 10 seconds to load, I'm gone! Learn how to increase your page speed (smaller file sizes on images, etc.)
4. **Social Proof -** Prove whatever you're selling _works_ and use testimonials or **legit** **facts/statistics.** I am not going to even remotely consider buying if I'm not convinced.
5. **Slider/Hero Shot -** Don't use basic, boring stock images if you expect people to take you seriously. Put some thought into the images you use - best to consider using a photographer/graphic designer if this isn't something you find yourself able to do.
6. **Video -** Also overlooked! If you can explain your product/services in video format this will further tighten your social proof concept. Seeing something in action helps seal the deal. It's best to use video further down the page after you've made your key convincing points.
7. **Keep Forms Short & Sweet -** You don't need to know _everything_ about your potential customers... you're only going to scare them away when you're asking for their photo I.D. & social security number. **Name** & **Email** should do in most cases.
8. **Remove Navigation** - If you already have your single call to action on your page, why confuse customer with more options to click? You've made the landing page to complete one goal - remove additional options, focus on your main objective.

I hope you've found this landing page breakdown helpful!
