  Have you ever imagined starting your day off... waking up with a view of the
  sun rising over the ocean from your tropical beach house… 


  Having nothing but a laptop, cup of coffee, and a good internet connection?

This is a reality for some digital nomads. 

That being said, this lifestyle _isn’t_ a vacation.

You may have ran into someone recently who when asked "What do you do for a living?" responded with 

> I work for myself. I'm a digital nomad.

## So, _what are **digital nomads?**_

> Digital nomads are individuals who work remotely via the internet. The platform from which they work is dependent on their industry and employer. Financial independence through self employment is a common theme seen in the digital nomad lifestyle. 

Breaking the traditional norm of an office setting, 9-5 hour work day, is something most people would say is a goal in their life. 

With internet access being readily available in almost every country, the need to always be in same place to get work done starts to become a thing of the past.

## What is the lifestyle of a digital nomad?

A common theme seen with digital nomads is the lack of ‘comforts’ most believe are needed.

Permanent housing, car payments, and other financial burdens associated with a ‘traditional’ lifestyle are often avoided. Without needing a permanent residence, many digital nomads are working towards financial and locational independence. 

Traveling is obviously a key factor in the digital nomad community.

Why _not_ see the world?

Location & obligation will always reign supreme in determining living arrangements for any given day, but here is a short list of how most remote workers seek living accommodations:

* Airbnb
* Coliving
* Coworking
* Hostel
* Hotel
* Housesit

I plan to go further in depth about how I feel about each accommodation listed above in another post.

Most digital nomads will still have a ‘homebase’ to say, some place they can spend a few weeks or months where their family or friends live. This can help reduce the costs of travel throughout the year and help maintain a sense normalcy.

## What are some digital nomad jobs/careers?

Career paths of a digital nomad can range from web developer to online teacher. 

There really is no barrier to entry to becoming a digital nomad other than the requirement of the work platform being (almost) completely online. It becomes very surprising just how many jobs could be done completely remotely.

I’ve compiled a general list of jobs that are commonly seen in the digital nomad community. Many in this list could be converted into your field of choice (i.e. ‘Consultant’ could be just about any field of work).

* Web Developer
* Graphic Designer
* UX Designer
* UI Designer
* Video Editor
* Sound Designer
* Videographer
* IT
  Specialist
* SEO
* Digital Marketer
* Email Marketer
* Teacher
* Consultant
* Content Writer
* Content Editor
* Help Support
* Lawyer
* Project Manager
* Transcriber
* App Developer
* Publisher
* Accountant
* Engineer
* Data Analyst
* Recruiter

As you can see, I’m just touching the surface here on remote jobs. 

I plan to write a guide going more in depth on how remote work can be achieved in these fields, but as you can see _almost_ any line of work can be done remotely. 

Digital nomads can often be seen as some of the hardest workers (especially in tech) as their livelyhood depends on it... None of us want to be stranded in a foreign country with no way out.

On the flip side, for whatever reason there is still a stigma about the 'working from home' type that continues to plague some traditional working industries.

## Steps to become a digital nomad (beginner)

While this lifestyle might _sound_ appealing, I'll be the first to admit **it's not for everyone**.

 Yes, traveling **can be very enjoyable**, but working while traveling isn't always...

I'm going to break down some steps that may be helpful for you in your journey into remote work and becoming a digital nomad.

### 1. Identify the Skills You're Good At

What are you currently doing for work? Does it include any of the jobs listed above? Can it be done purely remotely? Is it something you see yourself doing for an extended amount of time in the future?

These are all important questions to ask yourself **first** as it determines whether or not you are going to be able to do remote work in the first place.

A lot of people believe they can just jump into the digital nomad lifestyle - they may have a little saved up and think "I'll worry about work once I'm out there..."

**This is the wrong way to think about it.**

By identifying your skills (I recommend writing down a list) you'll have a better understanding of how you can begin to finance your well being.

### 2. Start Freelancing

This step I believe is one of the most important.

This is not the only way to become a digital nomad or to work remotely, but I see it as a stress test.

**Freelancing is work.** Work _**can**_ be hard.

Are you able to work for a client using one of the skills you identified above? 

**Try it out**. 

Get your first client. Complete a job for them.

How did you feel after? Was the job something you can see yourself doing while in a coffee shop? Does the client now have more work for you because you completed the job efficiently? Did the job pay well enough that you could continue to work for them?

Once you've answered the questions above you'll have a better understanding of what it is you're getting into. One client may not be enough, you may not have _liked_ the job you were given.

This can be a **hard stop** for some people in their pursuit of working remotely. 

If you've succeeded in the second step and are happy with the outcome, it's time to move on to the travel trial run.

### 3. Find Your First Travel Destination

Travel _is_ exciting.

There's no doubt about that.
Exploring new places is one of my favorite things in life. That being said, it can also be a major pain when you **have to work**.

My suggestion is to _pick somewhere **in your country** that you've never been to_ on your first trial run.

I'm talking about a place that you've never been, know nothing about, and haven't researched.

I suggest this for two reasons:

* **Familiarity**. You aren't leaving the country. The spoken language will most likely remain the same. Your surroundings will (mostly) be the same.
* **Cost**. Again, _you aren't leaving the country_. The overall cost of travel will be vastly cheaper than booking travel internationally. You may even be able to take a bus or train versus an expensive flight. 

So why suggest this? This is your trial run. You are still getting the experience of working remotely and traveling. You are still seeing a place you know nothing about and have never been before.

...Now, you've completed the first 3 major steps to becoming a digital nomad and working remotely.

You should now have a **general** sense of what the lifestyle is/could be.

**_How do you feel?_** 

**_What are some things you learned along the ride?_**

**_What would you do different next time?_**

_Please leave a comment below, as I'm very interested to hear from other people's experiences!_

In part 2 of this post I'll be diving into some **overlooked aspects of becoming a digital nomad**.

Thanks for reading & good luck!
